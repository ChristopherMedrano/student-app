# Student Database Application

Scenario: You are a Database Administration for a university and need to create
an application to manage student enrollments and balance. 

This application should do the following:

- Ask user how many students will be added to database
- The student should be prompted to enter the name and year for each student
- The student should have a 5-digit unique ID, with the first number being their grade level
- A student can enroll in the following courses: History 101, Math 101, English 101, Chemistry 101, Computer Science 101
- Each course costs $600 to enroll
- The student should be able to view their balance and pay tuition
- To see the status of the student, we should see their name, ID, courses enrolled, and balance
